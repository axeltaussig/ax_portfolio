            <p>TODOCHILLER is an industrial manufacturer of water coolers. It stands as the enduring legacy of my family's business,
            which was established in 1960 by Tomas Tom Taussig.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I consider myself fortunate to have shared moments with my family as we collectively nurtured the company and developed
            the business. The wisdom and heartfelt warmth I received are unparalleled.</p>
            <br/>
            <p className="mobile">In the photograph, you can observe Alejandro, Fabian, and Marcelo â€” the three brothers and proprietors of the
            enterprise. Their unique blend of skills, encompassing artistic, mechanical, and engineering talents, contributes to the
            company's success.
